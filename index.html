        <!-- STARTING OF BIRYANI RECIPE -->

        <li><h1>Biryani</h1></li>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><em>Biryani</em> is one of the most popular dishes in <em>South Asia</em>, as well as among the diaspora from the region. Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.[3] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.</p>

        <!-- STARTING OF DOSA RECIPE -->

        <li><h1>Masala-Dosa</h1></li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Arguably <em>South India's</em> most renowned culinary export, <em>masala dosas</em> are famous the world over. A sort of Indian pancake, dosas are made from a thin batter consisting of rice, flour and lentils. Traditionally, dosas are served folded in half and stuffed with potatoes. Accompaniments like hot sambar give the dish a spicy edge, and whatever you stuff them with, dosas are sure to provide a tasty yet satisfying meal.

        <li><h1>Paani Puri</h1></li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Pani puri</em>, or <em>gol guppa</em>, are thought to originate from the northern state of Bihar. Most Indians eat each pani puri with one swift bite, to save any of the filling spilling out of the delicate case. This infamous street snack unites most of the country - everyone from local college students to city businessmen can be found devouring them.
