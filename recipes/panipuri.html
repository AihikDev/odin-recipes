        <h1>Let's Get Started!</h1>

                <h3><em>Knead the dough</em></h3>
                To make this easy Paani Puri recipe at home, take a bowl and add semolina, wheat flour, baking soda along with a little salt and water as required and prepare a stiff dough. Adding semolina will make the puris crispy. Then, cover it with a muslin cloth, let it remain aside for about half an hour.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3><em>Roll out puris</em></h3>
                After half an hour, knead the flour again and roll out a few small-sized balls from the prepared dough. Next, place the balls on a flat surface and with the help of wheat flour, flatten and make them thin enough to give them the appearance of very small, round puris. You can alternately roll out a large puri and cut small discs with a round cookie cutter or small bowl.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3><em>Deep fry the puris</em></h3>
                Now, place a pan on medium flame and pour refined oil. Once the oil is sufficiently hot, fry the prepared round-shaped puris. Fry 3-4 at a time while making sure each one puffs all right. Also, keep the flame medium as excess heat might burn the puris.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3><em>Cool these fried puris</em></h3>
                Once well-cooked, take them out immediately and place them on a paper towel in order to get rid of extra oil. Let them cool and keep aside. Your next step would be to prepare paani for the puris.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3><em>Prepared the paani</em></h3>
                So first, take out a blender, put green chillies, coriander along with mint leaves and blend until smooth. Once done, transfer the chilli-mint paste to a jug and stir in tamarind paste, 4 cups of water, boondi, black salt, crushed jaggery, roasted and raw cumin seeds. Mix the mixture thoroughly.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3><em>Sieve to remove any impurities</em></h3>
                Then, make the prepared paani go through a sieve in order to remove the coarse particles. Once done, put it in the refrigerator to chill. Now all that remains is to prepare the stuffing for the puris. For that, take a bowl and combine mashed potato along with chickpeas. Add salt and pepper according to your taste.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3><em>Serve Paani Puri with chickpeas, tamarind chutney and the fresh paani</em></h3>
                Lastly, take the puris and make a small hole in each using your thumb. Stuff the chickpea-potato mixture in equal portions. Add a layer of green and tamarind chutney in them and serve alongside chilled mint paani. Enjoy this street food recipe with your loved ones.

        <h1>Helpful Tips!</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>For making super-crispy puris for Paani Puri or Gol Gappa, you can knead the dough with chilled club soda. This will not only make them swell up easily, but tastier as well.</li>

            <li>You can rest the dough for about 1-2 hours, but make sure that you cover it with a damp muslin cloth. If uncovered, the air might make the dough dry.</li>

            <li>For making those perfect puris, you can roll the ¼th part of the dough nice and thin, and then using a cookie cutter, cut the small puris and fry.</li>

            <li>You can store the puris in an air-tight container for about 10-15 minutes, so you can fry them in a large batch for later use.</li>

            <li>Also, make sure you knead a very hard dough for making your puris. If its’s not of the right consistency, your puris might not swell up.</li>
